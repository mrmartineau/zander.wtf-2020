Lorena Teruel and I were given free reign to update TMW's old website. We spent a number of weeks coming up with the strategy, UX and thinking behind the new version of the site.

Having such close collaboration with design, development and stakeholders meant that ideas were validated and tested in a massively reduced time. This was an entirely new approach for TMW and resulted in a complete shift in how new projects were developed at the agency.
