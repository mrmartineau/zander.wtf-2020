Equals (the rebranded FairFX) released the [Equals Go card product](https://equalsmoney.com/personal/travel-card). It is a multi-currency card with 15 currencies that makes it easier and cheaper for people to manage their money while abroad. I worked on the web app for this product, which encompassed the user account area for customers.
