In 2019 Equals released a brand new product, the [Equals Go card](https://equalsmoney.com/personal/travel-card). It is a multi-currency card with up to 15 currencies that makes it easier and cheaper for people to manage their money while abroad. I worked on the web app for this product, which encompassed the user account area for customers.
