I worked with ClubView, an early stage startup creating a data and AI product for football financing, to build various internal and external applications for their product.

Their projects spanned the entire stack and involved creating APIs, setting-up and managing PostgreSQL databases with TypeORM, as well as a performant React application. Besides what has previously been mentioned, this project makes use of Tailwind CSS, react-hook-form and Storybook for rapid component development.
