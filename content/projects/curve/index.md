I joined Curve to work on a greenfield project in partnership with Samsung. I developed a small, but important web application that was part of the wider user journey for the integration with the new Samsung Pay Card product. This application used Next.js with an Express.js back-end and integrated with various APIs from Samsung and internal Curve APIs.

I also created the first version of Curve's design system for the web. Initially with focus on product applications, the design system has since evolved into a more general system for all Curve's web properties. It is based on Theme UI.

The final project at Curve was to redevelop [curve.com](https://curve.com), the company's public-facing website. This used the Contentful headless CMS and the Gatsby static site generator. This project further iterated on the design system and made it commonplace within the web application team.

#### Notable Projects
