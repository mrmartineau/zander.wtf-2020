At [TMW](http://tmw.co.uk), I always ask interviewees how they keep up-to-date with the latest in front-end web goings-on. The answers I receive are varied but there's always a few recurring themes: Twitter and blogs - but which ones. I thought it would be a good idea to document my own 'stategy' for staying current, here it is.

### TL;DR

This is my 'recipe' for staying on top of web development trends, the focus is on Javascript, HTML, CSS, Responsive Web Design and Accessibility. Grab the full list of links here:

## Podcasts <small>[➤](https://pinboard.in/u:MrMartineau/t:on-staying-current/t:podcast/)</small>

### Javascript Jabber <small>[➤](http://javascriptjabber.com/)</small>

A weekly javascript podcast presented by [Joe Eames](http://twitter.com/josepheames), [Merrick Christensen](https://twitter.com/iammerrick), [Jamison Dance](http://twitter.com/jergason) and [Charles Max Wood](http://twitter.com/cmaxw). They recently featured [a show](http://javascriptjabber.com/046-jsj-staying-current/) which gave me the idea for this blog post, their's was purely javascript-based. Shows are typically over an hour long and focus on one topic; the discussions are very useful for gaining a high level understanding of a particular subject making it easy to find out more afterwards. Each show is transcribed which make it very easy to find the site they might have been discussing during the show.

### The Javascript Show <small>[➤](http://javascriptshow.com/)</small>

Another weekly javascript podcast; this time presented by [Peter Cooper](http://twitter.com/peterc) and [Jason Seifer](https://twitter.com/jseifer). Shows are typically 20 minutes long and usually feature a roundup of recent javscript news and plugin releases.

A weekly show about front end web design, development and UX presented by [Chris Coyier](http://css-tricks.com) and [Dave Rupert](https://twitter.com/davatron5000). I listen to this show sporadically but when I do I'm always impressed with the range of topics and in-depth understanding from all involved.

### The Breakpoint <small>[➤](http://cl.ly/NO5y) with Paul Irish and Addy Osmani</small>

From [Google Developers Live](https://developers.google.com/live/) comes a not-very-often podcast from some great developers, [Paul Irish](https://twitter.com/paul_irish) and [Addy Osmani](https://twitter.com/addyosmani). This podcast usually delves into the Chrome devtools to help developers make their sites for performant.

### HNPod <small>[➤](http://hnpod.com/)</small>

### No RSS love?

You might have noticed that I did not mention any RSS feeds here. The reason is because although I have a ridiculously organised Google Reader account, I just don't check it often enough. If you are hankering after a bunch of RSS feeds to add to your reader, you're in luck. Paul Irish has created 3 lists for you to import into your favourite reader, check them out [here](http://paulirish.com/2011/web-browser-frontend-and-standards-feeds-to-follow/)

### Can you add to my list?

Please let me know what you think of this list, is yours similar?
