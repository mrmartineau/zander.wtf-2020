I'm a bit of a pedant when it comes to the gear that I use everyday. I like to use good quality things that make my life easier.

I change aspects of my setup fairly often so this page will serve as a living document and a place to point curious developers to when I get asked.

## Hardware

### MacBook Pro ðŸ’»

I have the 2019 16" model. It's a fucking beast!

### [Code mechanical keyboard](https://codekeyboards.com/)

This is my day-to-day workhorce. It was my first foray into mechanical keyboards. It is a fairly straightforward tenkeyless keyboard and a real workhorse. I added the [Royal Navy keycap](http://www.ukkeycaps.co.uk/product/dsa-royal-navy-double-shot-keyset) set to personalise it a bit more.

### [WhiteFox mechanical keyboard](https://input.club/whitefox/)

This is my latest mechanical keyboard. I love the fact that it can easily be configured so the keys can be changed exactly to my preferences. I recently added the [MT3 /DEV/TTY keycap set](https://drop.com/buy/drop-matt3o-mt3-dev-tty-keycap-set) from Drop which are so good, I'm thinking of getting them for my Code keyboard.

### [Logitech Vertical mouse](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/mx-vertical-ergonomic-mouse)

This is my current mouse. It is an upgrade from my trusty [Anker Vertical Mouse](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Wireless-Vertical-Ergonomic-Optical-1600DPI/dp/B00BIFNTMC/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1538428340&sr=8-3&keywords=Anker+Wireless+Vertical+Ergonomic+Optical+Mouse). It is great for easing the stress on my wrist.

### [Logitech MX Master 3](http://amzn.eu/iGzdIg0)

I use this when working from home. It is a great, solid mouse with tonnes of buttons.

### [Autonomous Smart Desk 2](https://www.autonomous.ai/standing-desks/smartdesk-2-home)

Amazing and affordable standing desk

### [Herman Miller Celle](https://www.hermanmiller.com/en_gb/products/seating/office-chairs/celle-chairs/)

You need a proper chair for what we do all day.

### BenQ BL2711U 27-inch 4K Designer Monitor

Great monitor without being too pricey

## Apps

### [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/)

I use Alfred in nearly every aspect of my work. I use it for searching the net with its custom web searches (e.g. npm, JIRA, bundlephobia, MDN and many more); looking up obscure programming information with the Dash workflow; searching npm with the npms workflow and loads more. It truly is a massive productivity booster.

### [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Having been a long time Sublime Text user, I made the switch to VS Code last year and haven't looked back.

- VS Code theme: Always dark, I switch every few weeks between a few favourites: [Monokai Pro](https://monokai.pro/), [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/visual-studio-code/), [Neon Night](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chaseadamsio.vscode-theme-neon-night) or [Night Owl](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl).
- Code font: [IBM Plex Mono](https://www.ibm.com/plex/)

My settings can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/mrmartineau/ea3b428124bc1e31cd46dfa55469d781) and a list of my installed extensions can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/mrmartineau/28ef03c53275ea468e470532d6d20449). I also synchronise my settings to a [GitHub gist](https://gist.github.com/mrmartineau/425776a08d001fa9912119a9084ac9aa).

### [1Password](https://1password.com/) ðŸ”’

I never need to worry about passwords anymore. It integrates with my browser (via their extension) and the Mac app automatically copies one-time passwords to the clipboard so I don't even need to manually do it. It's also great on the iPhone; since iOS 12 was released, the integration with the OS is massively improved.

### [Notion](https://notion.so/)

I moved to Notion a few months ago and haven't looked back. It has most of what I want for a note-taking app with a healthy free-tier and Markdown-like input method.

### Browsers

Chrome is the main browser that I use when developing, but I use Firefox for everything else. I use [these extensions](https://gist.github.com/mrmartineau/b8b81009a1b3d941957ca14b11877a4b) at the moment.

### Terminal and the command line

I use [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) with [Fish Shell](https://fishshell.com/) instead of bash. See my config [here](https://github.com/mrmartineau/fish/blob/master/config.fish). I also use the excellent [Starship](https://starship.rs/) to improve my shell.

### [Tower](https://www.git-tower.com/mac)

The best git client for Mac.

### [NextDNS](https://www.nextdns.io/)

A cloud-based private DNS service that gives you full control over what is allowed and what is blocked on the Internet. There are Mac and iPhone apps that essentially block ads, malicious code and more.

### And the rest:

- [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/): The best Mac/iPhone-based task list/productivity app I know. Find out more from [The Sweet Setup](https://thesweetsetup.com/apps/best-personal-gtd-app-suite/).
- [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/): Window snapping and positioning.
- [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash): Dash is an API Documentation Browser and Code Snippet Manager. Devdocs.io or the [Devdocs app](https://devdocs.egoist.rocks/) are free alternatives.
- [NordVPN](https://nordvpn.com/): The best personal VPN service in my opinion. Great apps for Mac and iPhone.
- [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com/): Hide some of those pesky menubar items.
- [iStat Menus](https://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/): Monitor and display pretty much everything in my Mac's menubar
- [Micro Snitch](https://obdev.at/products/microsnitch/index.html): This little app displays a notification whenever your Mac's microphone or webcam are in use, so you always know when something is using them.
