I'm a bit of a pedant when it comes to the gear that I use everyday. I like to use good quality things that make my life easier.

I change aspects of my setup fairly often so this page will serve as a living document and a place to point curious developers to when I get asked.

## Hardware

### 14" M1 MacBook Pro ðŸ’»

I love this little thing. It should last a while.

### [Keychron K2v2](https://keychron.in/keychron-k2-v2/) Keyboard

It is bluetooth and has Cherry MX Blue switches. What's not to love.

### Mice

I alternate between the [Logitech Vertical mouse](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/mx-vertical-ergonomic-mouse) and the [Logitech MX Master 3](http://amzn.eu/iGzdIg0)

### [Autonomous Smart Desk 2](https://www.autonomous.ai/standing-desks/smartdesk-2-home)

Amazing and affordable standing desk

### [Herman Miller Aeron](https://www.hermanmiller.com/en_gb/products/seating/office-chairs/aeron-chairs/)

You need a proper chair for what we do all day.

### [MSI Prestige PS341WU Creator Monitor 34"](https://www.msi.com/Content-Creation-Monitor/Prestige-PS341WU)

Great wide-screen monitor without being too pricey

## Apps

### [Raycast](https://raycast.com/)

Raycast has usurped [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) for me now. I use it in nearly every aspect of my work. I use it for searching the net with its custom web searches (e.g. npm, JIRA, bundlephobia, MDN and many more); searching npm with the [npm extension](https://www.raycast.com/mrmartineau/search-npm) (that I created) workflow and loads more. It truly is a massive productivity booster.

FYI I also created the [GitHub Stars extension](https://www.raycast.com/mrmartineau/search-github-stars).

### [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Having been a long time Sublime Text user, I made the switch to VS Code last year and haven't looked back.

- VS Code theme: Always dark, I switch every few weeks, but my current favourite is [poimandres](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pmndrs.pmndrs). Some other favourites are [Monokai Pro](https://monokai.pro/) or the official [GitHub theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme).
- Code font: [Comic Code](https://tosche.net/fonts/comic-code). As much as I hate Comic Sans, I happen to LOVE Comic Code for coding.. who knew.

My settings can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/mrmartineau/ea3b428124bc1e31cd46dfa55469d781) and a list of my installed extensions can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/mrmartineau/28ef03c53275ea468e470532d6d20449). I also synchronise my settings to a [GitHub gist](https://gist.github.com/mrmartineau/425776a08d001fa9912119a9084ac9aa).

### [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/)

Vivaldi has been my main browser for a couple of years now. It is Chromium based so all my favourite Chrome extensions still work.

### [1Password](https://1password.com/) ðŸ”’

I never need to worry about passwords anymore. It integrates with my browser (via their extension) and it copies one-time passwords to the clipboard automatically. It's also great on the iPhone; since iOS 12 was released, the integration with the OS is massively improved.

### [DevUtils](https://devutils.app/?ref=zander)

This app is a recent addition and is an indispensible tool for my workflow.

### [Notion](https://notion.so/)

I moved to Notion a while back and haven't looked back. It has most of what I want for a note-taking app with a healthy free-tier and Markdown-like input method.

### Terminal and the command line

I use [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) with [Fish Shell](https://fishshell.com/) instead of bash. See my config [here](https://github.com/mrmartineau/fish/blob/master/config.fish). I also use the excellent [TIDE](https://github.com/IlanCosman/tide) prompt to improve my shell.

### [Tower](https://www.git-tower.com/mac)

The best git client for Mac.

### [NextDNS](https://www.nextdns.io/)

A cloud-based private DNS service that gives you full control over what is allowed and what is blocked on the Internet. There are Mac and iPhone apps that essentially block ads, malicious code and more.

### And the rest:

- [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/): The best Mac/iPhone-based task list/productivity app I know. Find out more from [The Sweet Setup](https://thesweetsetup.com/apps/best-personal-gtd-app-suite/).
