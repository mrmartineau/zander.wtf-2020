I read this [post](https://medium.com/@quasado/do-better-than-sketch-photoshop-or-any-other-design-tool-b8db106815a1) a while back about design stacks & it got me thinking about my own, albeit focused more on development. Below you'll find a fairly comprehensive list of the tools I regularly use for [front-end](https://news.layervault.com/click/stories/42206) development in a creative agency.

## Development apps

I use a Mac so some apps may not work on your platform :(

- [Sublime Text](http://sublimetext.com) ‚ú® is my IDE/Text editor of choice - Install [Package Control](http://packagecontrol.io) before anything else - [Emmet](http://emmet.io) is without doubt the most useful & time-saving plugin - For more recommended plugins, see my [previous post](/2014/07/sublime-text-for-front-end-development) on the subject
- [Chrome (dev release)](http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel) - I find this release balances new features with stability. I use it everyday without any issues. - Notable Extensions: + [WhatFont](http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel) - The easiest way to identify fonts on web pages + [Sauce Launcher](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sauce-launcher/mmcebionhdleomnkegjcoadpghnmcebl) - Launch Sauce Scout sessions in any browser you want with a single click + [Google Analytics Debugger](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-analytics-debugger/jnkmfdileelhofjcijamephohjechhna) + [Github Linker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-linker/jlmafbaeoofdegohdhinkhilhclaklkp) - Links NPM, bower, Composer & Duo dependencies to their GitHub repository page + [LiveReload](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei) - Chrome browser integration for LiveReload. Used in some of my Grunt tasks + [Extensions Manager](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/extensions-manager-aka-sw/lpleipinonnoibneeejgjnoeekmbopbc) - Enable/disable/manage extensions from the toolbar. Perfect if you masses of extensions like I do. + [Tab Scissors](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-scissors/cdochbecpfdpjobpgnacnbepkgcfhoek) - Splits a window into two at the selected tab. Useful if you have loads of tabs open at once
- [iTerm](http://iterm2.com) ‚ú® - A better Mac terminal emulator - My [.dotfiles](https://github.com/mrmartineau/dotfiles) repo is used sync my terminal settings across machines
- [Slack](http://slack.com) ‚ú® - The best team communication/private messenger app around

## Other useful apps

These apps are not specifically for development but they definitely help me get shit done.

- [Alfred](http://alfredapp.com) ‚ú® - Notable workflows: + [Will Farrell's](https://github.com/willfarrell/alfred-workflows) workflows for developers. My favourites are:

## Front-end tools

These tools are used on every project

- [Kickoff](http://tmwagency.github.io/kickoff) üíØ - The framework I helped create. I use it on every project, it is comprehensive without being verbose; give it a try! - Kickoff's grunt setup is extremely thorough & well documented, [give that a try](https://github.com/tmwagency/kickoff/blob/master/Gruntfile.js) if nothing else
- [Grunt.js](http://gruntjs.com) task runner - Favourite Grunt plugins include: + [BrowserSync](http://www.browsersync.io) - Billed as a tool to save time testing in the browser but I also use it for it's static server abilities too ‚Äî it is so good + [grunt-contrib-sass](https://github.com/grunt/grunt-contrib-sass) - I have tried the node port of sass, [grunt-sass](https://github.com/sindresorhus/grunt-sass) numerous times only for it to fail, I know it is potentially better but I will wait before making the switch. + [grunt-contrib-uglify](https://github.com/grunt/grunt-contrib-uglify) + [Grunticon](https://github.com/filamentgroup/grunticon) - cross-browser SVG FTW
- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) - CSS preprocessor
