My wife uses a simple version of a Cloze test when she teaches; she creates these tests using Word & a lot of copying & pasting.

When she saw my [Quick & Dirty Cloze test with Lettering.js](/2011/01/quick-dirty-cloze-content-test/) she asked if I could make a dedicated close test for her so I set about creating a basic webapp so that she could speed up this mundane task.

## Behold the Cloze creator

Try it out yourself at [zander.io/cloze-test/](http://zander.io/cloze-test/) & if you think it can be improved, I welcome your suggestions.

Also, I should thank a kind [Stack Overflow user](http://stackoverflow.com/users/546272/andy) for giving me a hand creating this.
