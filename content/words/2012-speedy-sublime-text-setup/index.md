A few weeks ago I created a Github repo to aide people in setting up Sublime Text more quickly. It lists the essential plugins that ‘most’ users will need & a few others for the programmers among you.

Please check it out, fork the project & help me make it better: [github.com/mrmartineau/SublimeTextSetupWiki](https://github.com/mrmartineau/SublimeTextSetupWiki)
