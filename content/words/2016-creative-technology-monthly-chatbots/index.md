> Welcome to Creative Technology monthly, this is the first issue of what we hope will be a long-running series here at TMW. It will cover topics ranging from design to development; artificial intelligence to hardware hacking; and much more.

## Chatbots 🤖

This month has been dominated, for the most part, by chatbots. Everyone seems to want one, and brands are no exception. At TMW, we have been investigating the various different types of bots and platforms, and have been creating some prototypes for our clients.

In our research, we have come across many different examples. Some were good, some were n0t-so-good, but all had something to offer. Below are some examples that caught my eye:

- Channel 4’s TV programme, Humans created an excellent bot recently to publicise their second season. It puts you into the heart of the story with one. Try it out [here](https://www.messenger.com/t/personasynthetics).
- [Poncho weather](https://www.messenger.com/t/hiponcho/) 🌦 has native smartphone apps, but it also has a brilliant Facebook Messenger bot. The copywriting is excellent and really enhances the experience for would normally be a simple utility.
- [HealthTap](https://www.messenger.com/t/HealthTap/) 🚑 is a Facebook Messenger bot that provides fast access to health care
- If you need help getting a Visa for the 🇺🇸 United States, [Visabot](http://visabot.co/) will be able to help you. It is the first immigration robot powered by artificial intelligence.

### Create your own bot

There are many bot development platforms, we have evaluated some and these are our recommendations:

#### [Chatfuel.com](https://chatfuel.com/) — Create a bot without any code

Chatfuel provides basic AI and hooks to many 3rd party services so you can actually create a fairly robust Facebook Messenger or Telegram bot with relative ease. It is excellent for simple bots or prototyping but I think that for complex bots where context is needed, other solutions like [wit.ai](https://wit.ai/) or [Gupshup](https://www.gupshup.io/) may be better.

#### [API.ai](https://api.ai/) — Conversational User Experience Platform

If you need a little more power, customisation and natural language from your bot, API.ai is the one to go for. It provides both voice and text API’s and has including a huge library of topics to allow your bot to be taught and respond naturally in most situations.

Special mention goes to [wit.ai](https://wit.ai/), [Gupshup](https://www.gupshup.io/) and [init.ai](https://init.ai/) for more developer-focused bot creation.

> You can find more bots at [Botlist](https://botlist.co/) or at [botpages.com](https://botpages.com/) and, for more information, [Chatbot magazine](https://chatbotsmagazine.com/) is invaluable for bot news and trends. [Bot Stash](http://www.botsfloor.com/botstash/) is also a great resource for all things bot-related.

## 🍔 Tech Team Activity

🗣 Ciaran Park, Denzil Brade, JP and myself all attended [#FFconf](https://ffconf.org/) recently, it was a brilliant few days with many inspiring talks. Watch this space for a full write-up.

🗣 In a recent #brunch&learn™ JP spoke about Redux Observables, he will be writing a piece about it soon.

🏐 I have been hard at work on the next version of Kickoff, version 8 of our front-end framework. If you’re interested in keeping up-to-date, please follow development in the [`v8` branch on the Github repo](https://github.com/TryKickoff/kickoff/tree/v8). The docs are also being improved, see the WIP [here](https://trykickoff.now.sh/).
